 Explain the concept of histogram problems and their applications in algorithm design.

answer-
A histogram problem typically refers to algorithmic challenges where you analyze or manipulate data represented as a histogram — meaning, bars of varying heights arranged in sequence (like a bar graph).

Applications in Algorithm Design


The histogram problem isn't just a standalone puzzle — its core concept of handling ranges, peaks, and efficient traversal using stacks or arrays shows up in a lot of places!


Problem	Application
🧱 Largest Rectangle in Histogram	                        For image processing, skyline computation, and stock span problems.
📏 Maximal Rectangle in a Binary Matrix	                  Used in 2D matrix problems — extend the histogram approach row by row.
💾 Histogram Equalization	                                In computer vision — for improving contrast in images.
📐 Area under Curve Approximation                         	Physics simulations, data visualization, and rendering.
📦 Container with Most Water (LeetCode problem)             	Similar logic to evaluate the largest area between two boundaries.
